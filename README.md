This program will simply run a very low volume sound to your speaker
to avoid getting unwanted noise when nothing is played
cause the speaker try to amplify nothing

How to use ? 

You need portaudio installed (it is probably already the case)

then simply run "make install" (**DO NOT RUN IS AT ROOT**) and you're good to go!

This will automatically enable a user service and start it. 

# How does this work ?

This program is generating endless Brown Noise (why brown noise though ? because i sometimes like to play it while studying, so i can use the same executable :)

(by default, the sound is inaudible)
